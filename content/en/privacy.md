## Introduction

Rotational Labs, Inc. (“Rotational,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects the privacy of its Users (“User,” “your,” or “you”). This Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use Rotational’s sites, products, and services.

Rotational is committed to protecting the privacy of its Users whose information is collected and stored while using Rotational’s sites, products, and services through our website or applications. We have a longstanding practice of undertaking internal privacy assessments of our products and services and of adopting a “privacy by design” approach to product development.  While we are always reviewing our existing privacy practices and security safeguards, we believe them to be robust and appropriate for the types of data we maintain on behalf of ourselves and our clients.

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Rotational Labs, Inc. collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users and clients (each, a “User”) of the [https://rotational.io](https://rotational.io) website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by Rotational Labs, Inc. at related websites.

WE DO NOT SELL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, NOR DO WE INTEND TO DO SO. WE DO NOT GIVE ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES EXCEPT TO SUBPROCESSORS TO ASSIST US IN THE PROVISION OF OUR SERVICES TO YOU.

Please contact [privacy@rotational.io](mailto:privacy@rotational.io) with questions about our privacy policy.

## Data Privacy Framework

We adhere to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which helps ensure that the personal data of our users is transferred and processed in a way that complies with EU data protection laws. We have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that Rotational follows the EU-US Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-US DPF Principles) for handling personal data received from the European Union under the EU-US DPF.

### What is the EU-US Data Privacy Framework?

The EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF), and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) were developed to facilitate transatlantic commerce by providing U.S. organizations with reliable mechanisms for personal data transfers to the United States from the European Union / European Economic Area, the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar), and Switzerland that are consistent with EU, UK, and Swiss law.

### What does this mean for you?

By adhering to the DPF, Rotational provides several key assurances to our users and clients:

- **Jurisdiction**: The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over our compliance.
- **Transparency**: We clearly explain how we collect, use, and share your personal data through our Privacy Policy and other resources.
- **Data Protection Principles**: We abide by the DPF’s principles, which are similar to those of the GDPR and Swiss data protection laws. These principles include:

    - *Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency*: We only process your data transparently and for lawful purposes.
    - *Purpose limitation*: We only use your data for the purposes it was collected.
    - *Data minimisation*: We only collect and process the minimum amount of data necessary for the stated purpose.
    - *Accuracy*: We strive to keep your data accurate and up-to-date.
    - *Storage limitation*: We only store your data for as long as necessary for the stated purpose.
    - *Integrity and confidentiality*: We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
    - *Accountability*: We are responsible for complying with these principles and are subject to enforcement mechanisms.

- **Individual Rights**: You have certain rights concerning your personal data, such as the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, and object to processing.
- **Redress Mechanism**: You have access to an independent mechanism for resolving complaints about our data practices.

You can view our certification online by visiting the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at [dataprivacyframework.gov](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

Rotational remains responsible for any of your personal information shared with subprocessors for external processing on our behalf, as described in the “Sharing Personal Information” section of our Privacy Policy.

In adherence to our privacy policy, if any concerns regarding personal data, as per the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) principles, remain unresolved internally, customers are encouraged to utilize our designated third-party dispute resolution provider EU DPA through the [US Council for International Business](https://uscib.org/), free of charge.

Additionally, we agree to cooperate with relevant data protection authorities in the European Economic Area and the UK, if necessary, to address any outstanding complaints.

Under certain conditions (as described under the EU-US DPF Principles that Rotational adheres to), you may invoke binding arbitration by delivering a notice to us via [privacy@rotational.io](mailto:privacy@rotational.io), including when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. Rotational is also subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.

We will remain liable for onward transfers of your personal data to third parties (including our Service Providers) in accordance with applicable data transfer mechanisms. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-US DPF Principles and the UK GDPR, the Principles shall govern with respect to personal data transferred under the DPF. To learn more about the DPF program, including its application in the UK, and to view our certification, please visit [dataprivacyframework.gov](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).
