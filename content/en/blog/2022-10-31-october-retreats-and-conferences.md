Even though we are a fully distributed team, we celebrate curiosity, collaboration, and growth together in-person as much as we can. We've maintained a tradition of combining tech conferences with team retreats and this October we had our second 2022 retreat in Chicago, Illinois colocated with GopherCon 2022. We also attended KubeCon 2022 in Detroit at the end of the month.

Our goal is to have two team retreats a year whenever possible; ensuring that even though we all work from home, we stay connected and creative. In 2021, our retreats were in St. Mary's, Maryland and Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 2022, our first retreat was in Salt Lake City, Utah, colocated with PyCon 2022 and we just concluded our second retreat in Chicago, Illinois colocated with GopherCon 2022.

Now that the team has grown from 4 to 11 we want to ensure that the retreats grow both the company and us as individuals. Our idea is that one retreat a year will be "top-down" focusing on business strategy, culture, and presentations from the team on specific topics. The second retreat will be "bottom-up" guided by the team rather than a pre-planned agenda and engaging in creative activities and exploration.

Our retreat in Chicago was a bottom-up retreat. We stayed in an airbnb together and enjoyed getting to know each other with dinner games such as two truths and a lie, would you rather, and ask me anything. We had a hackathon where we developed the first publishers to send data through the Ensign platform, did competitive research, gave presentations on topics the team is interested in, and considered how we could publish an academic research paper. We went on a river tour through the city, went to the skydeck on the Willis Tower, and generally had a fabulous time exploring Chicago.

After the retreat, we attended GopherCon -- the first GopherCon for everyone on the team. Rebecca gave a talk on building distributed systems (and should you) on the main stage, and the rest of the team actively engaged in all of the talks and joining the GopherCon community. Later that month we continued our conference circuit in Detroit where Rebecca and Patrick gave a talk on our experience with multi-cluster distributed systems and where we caught up with our community of fellow open source contributors.

Geography is essential to Rotational's distributed platform and so it seems natural that our team enjoys travel. The pandemic has constrained us to the continental United States for the first two years of our startup, but we're certainly looking forward to new horizons and traveling the globe together!
