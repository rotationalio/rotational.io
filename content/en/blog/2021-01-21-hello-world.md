Today my partners [Dr. Rebecca Bilbro]({{< ref "/author/rebecca-bilbro.md" >}}), [Edwin Schmierer]({{< ref "/author/edwin-schmierer.md" >}}), and I have embarked on a journey to develop commercial planetary-scale systems and applications with Rotational Labs. Our hypothesis is that the Internet and the cloud provide the opportunity to rapidly develop applications that quickly reach an international audience, however just because the tools exist doesn't mean it's going to be easy. "Context is king" to quote some of our closest advisors, and intelligent distributed systems that can take context into account without homogenizing experience is our primary goal.

"Hello World" is the traditional first computer program, but here we mean it in an additional way. We want to develop respectful systems that create meaningful interactions between people in diverse parts of the world with diverse cultural backgrounds. "Hello World" is meant to signify that we believe the world is a big place and that to tackle big problems that affect us all, we need to find means to cooperate effectively together. "Hello World" means that seemingly simple outcomes are borne of the complex interactions of simple components. For us, technology is not a panacea; it is the means by which we can collaborate and produce change and value.

Our name, Rotational, reflects this as a nod to the diurnal cycles we all experience. If you imagine a system that spans the globe, then likely it will be utilized more in parts of the world where it is daylight, and as the planet rotates, utilization will also shift. To me, this describes an ecological experience that we all sense but don't recognize enough; we're all part of the same system, just using it from different times and spaces. We're technologists, so we can best contribute to our shared experience through software development. The challenge we've set ourselves is to figure out how to create a system that is simultaneously global and hyperlocal, that is both diverse and unifying, that is intelligent, fair, and adaptable.

There are trade-offs and contradictions in that challenge; ones we've tried to confront as directly as possible in our research and will continue to confront in our work. What we will strive to offer is thoughtfulness and honesty; and to create a culture of learning that celebrates both learning from other perspectives as well as learning from our mistakes. Hello world, we can't wait to work with you!
