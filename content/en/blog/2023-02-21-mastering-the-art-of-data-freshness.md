Two decades ago Clive Humby proclaimed "data is the new oil", marking an economic shift towards data products. But, if the intervening years have taught us anything, it's to think of data more like fresh fruit.

A few weeks ago, Jordan Tigani, a founding engineer for BigQuery introduced a new polemic &mdash; ["Big Data is Dead"](https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email). He argues that most companies actually don't have enough data to justify their spending on the data management tools that he admittedly once espoused, and asks the reader to consider whether they are in the "one percent" of companies who actually need and use big data. While his article makes some very important points (especially that data can be a liability as it grows and ages), we can't help but wonder if it's a bit of a circular argument. Just as money (when well-managed) tends to make more money, so does data tend to make more data.

Back in 2016, in ["The Age of the Data Product"](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/the-age-of-the-data-product), our CEO Benjamin Bengfort explored the changing economic landscape that was driving the burgeoning field of data science:
> A data product is an economic engine. It derives value from data and then produces more data, more value, in return...This is precisely what has led to the surplus of information and the resulting information revolution. More importantly, it is the generative effect that allows us to achieve better living through data, because more data products mean more data, which means even more data products, and so forth.

So perhaps what differentiates the "big data one percent" from the rest is not merely that they have more data, but that they've figured out how to build self-sustaining data engines &mdash; data products that make more data. In our view, this comes down not to sheer volume of data, but to mastering the art of data freshness.

## A Trip To the Supermarket
Let’s start with a simple scenario. Imagine you visit the supermarket. You buy $100 worth of food. A week later, you’ve eaten less than $20 worth of the food you bought. What can you do? Most likely, you’ll buy less next time. Or, maybe you buy another fridge or possibly eat more, faster. The point is, *you do something*.

## You’ll Get Nothing and Like It?
Now let’s switch to a business context; you’re an executive. Data is the food that fuels your business. Arguably, it’s your most important asset. Maybe it’s key to your future AI plans (hello, ChatGPT!).

According to [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech), businesses use less than 20% of data they generate. Data silos persist despite the rise of data warehouses and data lakes. Why? It’s just too dang hard to move and synchronize data. And everyday it sits, it loses value. We heard the same after talking to over one hundred organizations, from startups to Fortune 500s, operating and building applications, data products, and services. And the problem is only getting worse.

We get it. Putting data in motion is hard. But still we have to ask: What executive would ever accept a less than 20% utilization on such an important asset?

## A Better Option: FlexStreams
We built [Ensign](https://rotational.io/ensign/), our cloud-native, cloud agnostic data activation platform, to make it easy to get data in motion quickly and securely so businesses can innovate and grow. With Ensign, you can set up any number of flexible and secure event streams - what we call **FlexStreams** - to get data to the right process at the right time and place with no additional investment in infrastructure or unexpected costs. It’s a “low ops”/ “no ops” way to get your data in motion quickly and securely. Generate more value at 1/10 the cost.

## You *Can* Do Something!
To all the frustrated execs out there, it’s time to do something! We don’t expect you to believe our word so we invite you to try yourself (or more realistically your technical team). No credit card or long-term contract required. Doesn’t matter if you’re in the cloud, on prem, or hybrid. Doesn’t matter what type of data you have. Doesn’t matter if you have legacy systems. We’ll meet you where you are. What does matter is you have to care about getting the most value from your data. If you do, we guarantee we’ll move the needle in the right direction for you.

What have you got to lose? Think about that the next time you take a trip to the supermarket.
