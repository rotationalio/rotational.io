description: After spending my first year as a junior developer at Rotational Labs, it's time to reflect on some lessons learned along the way.

Over the past year as a junior developer at Rotational Labs, I've learned a lot and grown to value several things.

While casually browsing social media, I often come across posts devoted to junior developers. Quite often, they’re focused on sharing tips for how to get that first job. Lately, I’ve noticed more messaging aimed at answering the questions that juniors may have after securing their first job. 

Last year, I joined Rotational Labs as a Jr. Distributed Systems Engineer. Going from learning to code via the 100 Devs bootcamp to working professionally at a startup has required me to learn a lot over the past year. However, instead of attempting to share tips that may or may not be useful to other junior devs, I'd like to share some of the lessons I've learned over the past year. Hopefully, they may be helpful to others who are just starting out.

### Pair Programming / Co-Working Has Not Let Me Down

Every time I’ve pair programmed or co-worked, I’ve gained a considerable amount of knowledge. Working in this way has helped me to get up to speed on a codebase quicker and see how my colleagues process information in real-time.

In the beginning, I’ll admit to feeling more like an observer. It was like I was trying to soak up what others were saying or writing. However, over time, it has helped me gain more confidence in asking questions and sharing my opinions or ideas whether while coding together or during other meetings.

Also, checking out other people’s setups is fun and I often discover new plugins that make my life much easier.

### Use Tools More Effectively

The days I learned about GitLens and VS Code’s "Go To Definition" feature should probably be celebrated. The amount of time this has saved me cannot be overstated.

This may not seem like a big deal, but previously I'd only ever searched for features and settings to resolve minor annoyances when I was just learning how to code. I didn’t see a need to use certain features especially since I was working on projects alone or with small groups where the codebase was just as small.

In the end, what I’ve learned is the importance of truly getting to know the tools I’m using and how to utilize them to my benefit. It’s impossible to learn every little thing, but taking time to play around with settings could truly make a big difference.

### Code Reviews Are Great Learning Opportunities

In the beginning, I would get a little nervous whenever I was asked to do a code review. What if I missed something? Would the team realize how terrible I am at coding?

These days, the anxiousness and misplaced thoughts are gone. They've been replaced with a realization that I might see a package I'm not familiar with or an approach I'd not thought of before that could unlock a problem I've been attempting to resolve.

Another benefit is that code reviews have helped me become more comfortable. Of course, it's different from having the totality of a codebase, but being able to understand changes and ask questions for clarity has made code reviews enjoyable.

### Continuous Education Is Important, But I Won't Let It Disrupt My Personal Time

Before joining Rotational, I had no experience with Golang and what was this Docker thing I kept hearing about? Though I was experienced with JavaScript and React, I still needed to take a deeper dive into both. Oh and did I mention that I had 0 idea of what a distributed system was before the recruitment process began? 

Thankfully, we value making time for continuous learning is important. However, I found myself internally putting pressure on myself to learn all of the things. I’d tell myself that I’d need to spend a good majority of my time after work “catching up” on what I didn’t know.

To be honest, this didn’t work because I still had other important stuff to do outside of work. Not only that, but I just needed to spend more time away from the computer screen. Now, I’m not saying that devs shouldn’t use their non-work time to study. In fact, I still do it. The only difference now is that I don’t get upset with myself if I don’t.

By the way, I still haven’t learned all of the things and that’s ok.
