Data encryption and compression are heavyweight algorithms that must be used with care in performance intensive applications; but when applying both mechanics to the same data, which should come first?

**Editor's note: the original version of this blog post had a different result, but thanks to Michael Andersen and Ori Bernstein and an [excellent discussion on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7125171935449157633/) I've updated this post.**

At Rotational, we routinely use encryption and compression to guarantee privacy and maximize storage. Before applying data to the Ensign [log](https://ensign.rotational.dev/system/broker/), your events must be both encrypted and compressed &mdash; which led me to the question; which operation should I apply first to ensure [Ensign](https://rotational.app/) is as performant as possible? The answer surprised me.

> Compression should be applied before encryption otherwise compression will do nothing.

For whatever reason, I had it in my head that cryptography was a heavier-weight algorithm than compression, and that any cryptographic algorithm would take a large number of CPU cycles. I reasoned, therefore, that compression should be applied first -- minimizing the amount of cryptographic work required. To be sure, I wrote some [benchmarks in Go](https://gist.github.com/bbengfort/6b6c7957380ec3cda22ea36b21e2d4f2) and was surprised to discover that actually modern CPUs handle encryption very effectively and compression is the heavier-weight operation.

_However, pure throughput is not the only measure of performance_. My original blog post created some surprise on LinkedIn because experts in cryptography noted that compression should have no effect on ciphertext, otherwise it would [violate semantic security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_security). It is possible that encypting before compression is faster because no compression is possible. When you compare [data compression ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression_ratio), it is clear that you _must apply compression before encryption otherwise compression will have no effect_.

The results from my benchmark show the performance as the average number of nanoseconds it takes to complete each operation. The methods are described below:

1. `Encrypt` and `Decrypt`: are the cryptography primitives that use AES-CGM to convert plaintext into ciphertext with a symmetric 32-byte key and vice-versa.
2. `Compress` and `Decompress`: utilize gzip compression built into Go to minimize the space data takes up; two levels of compression are used: _"best speed (fast)"_ and _"best compression (compact)"_.
3. `CryptPress` and `DecryptPress`: applies cryptography first, then compression (the inverse operation decompresses first, then decrypts).
4. `PressCrypt` and `DepressCrypt`: applies compression first, then cryptography (the inverse operation decrypts first, then decompresses).

Encryption first then compression (and its inverse operation) is almost 1.5x faster than applying compression. However, the result is no compression of the data and in order to reduce your data storage size, you must compress first.

## Methodology

In order to simulate a real-world use case, the benchmarks were applied to JSON formatted data of NOAA weather alerts that is 1,096,280 bytes and compressed to 143,277 bytes using the default compression level.

All of the code used to implement cryptography and compression on the dataset can be found [in this Gist](https://gist.github.com/bbengfort/6b6c7957380ec3cda22ea36b21e2d4f2). Benchmarks were implemented with the Go testing benchmarks and the output on my MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Max chip and 64GB of memory was as follows:

### Encryption/Decryption

For our encryption methodology, we used [AES-GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) with a 256 bit block size. We generated a single, 32-byte key at the start of the benchmarks, and used the same key across all benchmarks. For each benchmark, we generated a 12 byte nonce and appended the nonce to the encrypted data.

The `Encrypt` function was implemented as follows:

```golang
func Encrypt(plaintext []byte) ([]byte, error) {
	block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	gcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(block)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	nonce := make([]byte, 12)
	if _, err := rand.Read(nonce); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	ciphertext := gcm.Seal(nil, nonce, plaintext, nil)
	ciphertext = append(ciphertext, nonce...)
	return ciphertext, nil
}
```

Both encryption and decryption used Golang standard library packages, including [`crypto/aes`](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/aes) and [`crypto/cipher`](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/cipher). No third party libraries were used.

The `Decrypt` function was implemented as follows:

```golang
func Decrypt(ciphertext []byte) ([]byte, error) {
	block, err := aes.NewCipher(key)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	gcm, err := cipher.NewGCM(block)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	plaintext, err := gcm.Open(nil, ciphertext[len(ciphertext)-12:], ciphertext[:len(ciphertext)-12], nil)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return plaintext, nil
}
```

### Compression/Decompression

We used the Golang standard library [`compress/gzip`](https://pkg.go.dev/compress/gzip) for compression. The `flate` package used by `gzip` has different options for compression including `gzip.BestSpeed` and `gzip.BestCompression` -- we benchmarked on both of these extremes rather than using `gzip.DefaultCompression` to see the range of performance provided by `gzip`. It turns out that even using `gzip.BestSpeed` -- compression performance is still significantly less than the performance of symmetric cryptography.

The `Compress` function was implemented as follows:

```golang
func Compress(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {
	buf := &bytes.Buffer{}
	archive, _ := gzip.NewWriterLevel(buf, gzip.BestCompression)
	if _, err := archive.Write(data); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	if err := archive.Close(); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return buf.Bytes(), nil
}
```

The `gzip` package in Golang expects to be reading/writing to a file-like object. To implement our methods which must return byte arrays, we used a `bytes.Buffer` as our intermediate object that implemented `io.WriteCloser` and `io.ReadCloser`.

The `Decompress` function was implemented as follows:

```golang
func Decompress(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {
	buf := bytes.NewBuffer(data)
	archive, err := gzip.NewReader(buf)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	defer archive.Close()
	return io.ReadAll(archive)
}
```

The `PressCrypt`, `CryptPress`, `DepressCrypt`, and `DecryptPress` functions simply used the above functions in differing orders. The input to each of these functions was the byte array of JSON data loaded from the fixture data and the output was the encrypted/compressed data (or an error).

## Conclusion

There are two major takeaways here for other teams out there working to maximize performance for high-throughput data systems and applications, and here they are:

1. **Apply compression *before* encryption.**
2. **Test your assumptions &mdash; they might be slowing you down or tripping you up!**

We hope this post inspires you to do both!
