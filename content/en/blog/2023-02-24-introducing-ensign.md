Introducing Ensign -- eventing made easy! Have you always wanted to try out eventing, but couldn’t justify the high cost of entry or the expertise required? Keep reading!

## Introducing Ensign
This month is an exciting one for Rotational Labs. We’re launching [Ensign](https://rotational.io/ensign), our developer platform for building event-driven applications and machine learning models.

What are we sellin’? Simplicity as a service for event-driven microservices.

Ensign makes it fast (and fun) for data teams to leverage the publish-subscribe model for event-driven microservices, real-time machine learning, and data pipelines. It helps companies unlock the hidden value in data silos to grow and innovate.

Want to build...

- new prototypes without refactoring legacy database schemas?
- real-time dashboards and analytics in days rather than months?
- rich, tailored experiences so your users know how much they mean to you?
- MLOps pipelines that bridge the gap between the training and deployment phases?

Ensign is about no-hassle event-driven applications, models, and dashboards. All it takes is an API key and a few lines of code. No additional infrastructure. No surprise costs.

## “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’“
Yup, we hope to curry as much fame and fortune as Michael Jackson! Seriously, we do wanna be startin’ somethin’!

Why’d we do it? One word: empathy. Event-driven architecture is a powerful framework but it’s also pretty inaccessible because you often need highly specialized skills, tools, or infrastructure.

We want to take away that friction and empower teams to collaborate and innovate across data, services, and applications to create new applications, services, and models. As [engineers and data scientists ourselves](https://rotational.io/about/), we’ve personally felt the pain. We’ve worked with a variety of clients and talked to hundreds of engineers and data scientists who have also experienced the friction of getting data in motion and building new services and models.

We also want to make it easy for organizations to unlock the value of their data without the need for complicated tools or know-how. Set up a secure event stream and you’re in business. Build the applications, machine learning models, and dashboard that makes sense for your organization. Even better, Ensign is flexible enough to work with legacy infrastructure. Your event streams can adapt as your organization changes.

## An Invitation to Experiment

So, we invite you to experiment. It’s easy to get started. No need for a credit card.

1. [Create an account](https://rotational.app/register) and generate your API key
2. [Read the docs](https://ensign.rotational.dev/getting-started/)
3. Integrate with your app, model, or dashboard

What can you build with eventing superpowers? Need some inspiration? Check out some [ideas](https://ensign.rotational.dev/examples/) we came up with.
