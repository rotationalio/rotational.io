Employee shame can be a significant barrier to adopting automation in the workplace, even when automation could help. Find out why the most important stop on your AI roadmap is empathy, and three use cases you may find on your journey.

Consider the following scenario, which may sound familiar:

> It’s Monday morning, and Jada’s fingers move mechanically across the keyboard, inputting data she knows is a bit off. She’s spent an hour copying and pasting into this mind-numbing spreadsheet. She knows she's making mistakes. A value pasted into the wrong cell here, an incorrect label applied there. Small errors used to haunt her, but now just feel inevitable. This isn’t what she signed up for. Her degree and promotion were supposed to lead somewhere meaningful, not to mindless tasks. But she doesn’t care anymore. No one even reads these. She sighs and hits "save" on another report for the Workplace Efficiency Taskforce. The irony stings.

If the best applications of AI promise to free us up to focus on more creative, strategic tasks, why aren't dishes and email solved yet? Unfortunately, the first wave of "workplace AIs" met much [user resistance](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/ai-surveillance-in-the-workplace-linked-to-employee-resistance--). Though likely the result of poor UI/UX and overly aggressive rollouts, VCs often attribute weak adoption to things out of their control, such as an [aging workforce afraid of being automated out of a job.](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/why-ai-will-save-the-world)

But I gotta say &mdash; I've worked in a lot of different companies and it's hard for me to imagine masses of workers intentionally sabotaging AI adoption in the interest of protecting the sacred ground of filling out timesheets and skimming emails. Probably they're just skeptical. Is there anyone out there who doesn't feel at least a little limited by your company's "stack"?

I think successful AI adoption often starts with building (possibly, rebuilding) trust.In my experience, feelings of **shame**, like those described in Jada's story above, can prevent employees from identifying use cases that would be ideal for automation, even if doing so might improve employee engagement.  Here are three AI use cases, cloaked in scenarios where an employee might be ashamed to admit they need automation, along with some tips on how automation (and a little empathy) could help:

## Data Entry

> Emma works as a financial analyst at a mid-sized company. Every Friday, she spends hours manually entering financial data from receipts, invoices, and bank statements into the company's accounting software. She knows the process is repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. But despite the frustration, she keeps doing it. If she admits she’s doing repetitive data entry, she might be seen as inefficient or lacking in analytical skills. After all, her job title should be about interpreting data, not copying and pasting figures.

By automating the data entry process with tools like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or AI-powered financial software, Emma and her team could populate accounting records from scanned documents and online receipts. This would save Emma hours of manual work each week and reduce errors. With the time saved, Emma could shift her focus to more value-adding tasks, such as financial forecasting or analysis. In my experience, adding automation in these cases not only improves the productivity and job satisfaction of individuals like Emma, it also leads to more accurate financial insights, and better decisions, with the human-in-the-loop acting as a supervisor to a suite of tools that absorb the drudgery.

## Customer Support Ticket Sorting

> Chris works as a customer support specialist for an e-commerce company. Each day, he sifts through dozens of customer inquiries, sorting them into categories and assigning them to the appropriate teams. The process is monotonous and repetitive, often requiring Chris to review each ticket for issues that could easily be identified by software. Chris feels that if he admits that the task of sorting tickets is not only mundane but also inefficient, he might be perceived as unskilled in problem-solving, which is the essence of his job. He’s worried that asking for automation would make him seem less capable of handling the workload.

Implementing a ticketing support system that helps Chris classify and prioritize support tickets could reduce the time he has to spend manually triaging and sorting. By analyzing the content of each inquiry, the system could draft up support tickets, suggest the correct department, and flag potentially urgent issues. Chris could spend more time addressing complex and urgent requests and providing personalized support. This would allow Chris to focus on higher-level problem-solving, which he is better suited for, and it will also allow Chris's company to maintain their brand as a company that puts customer service first.

## Inventory Management

> Sarah is the operations manager at a small retail chain. Each week, she manually updates the inventory system by checking stock levels, comparing them with sales data, and ordering products. This task takes up a significant portion of her week, and she frequently has to deal with discrepancies and human error when inputting data. Yet Sarah is hesitant to acknowledge how inefficient and outdated this manual process is. She feels that as an operations manager, it’s her responsibility to ensure the system runs smoothly &mdash; if she were to ask for automation, she might appear as if she’s not capable of keeping track of inventory using standard best practices.

Introducing an AI inventory management system could streamline this process. By integrating barcode scanning and real-time data syncing, the system could update stock levels and reorder items when they reach a minimum threshold. This would result in fewer stockouts and overstock situations, reducing operational costs and improving sales. Furthermore, Sarah could shift her focus to process optimization and vendor negotiations, areas that could drive higher profitability and help her grow as a leader in the organization.


## The Empathetic AI Leader

These kinds of use cases have cropped up in dozens of companies I have worked with and for, where automation could make things more efficient or accurate, or improve employee satisfaction. But for employees like Jada, Emma, Chris, and Sarah, the shame of admitting they need help can make these use cases invisible.

I think this is why the business leaders who are having the most success with AI all seem to understand that being an empathetic ear to the folks in the trenches is the way. They start with connecting, building trust, and listening. With a culture of trust comes a workplace where employees feel motivated and safe enough to identify the tasks ripe for automation, and to help make better tools and processes. By removing the stigma around automation, we not only improve business outcomes but also empower employees to do the work they were hired to do.

**Here's a tip...** Get the ball rolling! At your next All Hands Meeting, share an example of a repetitive, boring task you have had to do (either recently or in the past) and talk about how it made you feel.
