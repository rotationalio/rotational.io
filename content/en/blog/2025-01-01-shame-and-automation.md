Employee shame can be a significant barrier to adopting AI in the workplace, even when automation could help. In this post, an AI expert shares 3 concrete examples of how empathy can unlock AI opportunities and create a virtuous cycle.

## How Shame Impedes Automation

Consider the following scenario, which may sound familiar:

> It's Monday morning and Jada’s fingers move mechanically across the keyboard, filling in the empty cells. She’s already spent an hour copying and pasting into this mind-numbing spreadsheet. She knows she's making mistakes. Small errors used to haunt her, but now just feel inevitable. A value pasted into the wrong cell here, an incorrect label applied there. This isn’t what she signed up for. Last year's promotion was supposed to lead somewhere meaningful, not to mindless tasks. But she doesn’t care anymore. No one even reads these. She sighs and hits 'save' on another report for the Workplace Efficiency Taskforce. The irony stings.

If the best applications of AI promise to free us up to focus on more creative, strategic tasks, why aren't dishes and email solved yet? Rather than enthusiasm, the first wave of enterprise "workplace AIs" has instead met [user resistance](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/employee-relations/ai-surveillance-in-the-workplace-linked-to-employee-resistance--). Though poor user adoption is usually down to bad UI/UX and overly aggressive rollouts, VCs often attribute failure to things out of their control, such as an [aging workforce afraid of being automated out of a job.](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/why-ai-will-save-the-world)

But as someone who has been working for two decades now, I'm skeptical about that explanation. It's hard to imagine masses of workers intentionally sabotaging AI adoption in the interest of protecting the sacred ground of filling out timesheets and skimming emails. Probably they're just skeptical, too. As an employee, it's hard not to be a bit skeptical about enterprise software. How many timesheet software tools have you had to learn? How many times have we seen flashy new features released while bugs and inefficient processes go unresolved?

At Rotational, we take the perspective that AI adoption often starts with building (possibly, rebuilding) trust. In my experience, feelings of **shame**, like those described in Jada's story above, can prevent employees from identifying use cases that would be ideal for automation, even if doing so might improve employee engagement.  In this post, I'll share three AI use cases based on real automation projects I've worked on, along with some tips on how automation (and a little empathy) could help.

### Data Entry

> Emma works as a financial analyst at a mid-sized company. Every Friday, she spends hours manually entering financial data from receipts, invoices, and bank statements into the company's accounting software. She knows the process is repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to errors. But despite the frustration, she keeps doing it. If she admits she’s doing repetitive data entry, she might be seen as inefficient or lacking in analytical skills. After all, her job title should be about interpreting data, not copying and pasting figures.

By automating the data entry process with tools like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or AI-powered financial software, Emma and her team could populate accounting records from scanned documents and online receipts. This would save Emma hours of manual work each week and reduce errors. With the time saved, Emma could shift her focus to more value-adding tasks, such as financial forecasting or analysis. In my experience, adding automation in these cases not only improves the productivity and job satisfaction of individuals like Emma, it also leads to more accurate financial insights, and better decisions, with the human-in-the-loop (Emma) acting as a supervisor to a suite of tools that absorb the drudgery.

### Customer Support Ticket Sorting

> Chris works as a customer support specialist for an e-commerce company. Each day, he sifts through dozens of customer inquiries, sorting them into categories and assigning them to the appropriate teams. The process is monotonous and repetitive, often requiring Chris to review each ticket for issues that could easily be identified by software. Chris feels that if he admits that the task of sorting tickets is not only mundane but also inefficient, he might be perceived as unskilled in problem-solving, which is the essence of his job. He’s worried that asking for automation would make him seem less capable of handling the workload.

Implementing a ticketing support system that helps Chris classify and prioritize support tickets could reduce the time he has to spend manually triaging and sorting. By analyzing the content of each inquiry, the system could draft up support tickets, suggest the correct department, and flag potentially urgent issues. Chris could spend more time addressing complex and urgent requests and providing personalized support. This would allow Chris to focus on higher-level problem-solving, which he is better suited for, and it will also allow Chris's company to maintain their brand as a company that puts customer service first.

### Inventory Management

> Sarah is the operations manager at a small retail chain. Each week, she manually updates the inventory system by checking stock levels, comparing them with sales data, and ordering products. This task takes up a significant portion of her week, and she frequently has to deal with discrepancies and human error when inputting data. Yet Sarah is hesitant to acknowledge how inefficient and outdated this manual process is. She feels that as an operations manager, it’s her responsibility to ensure the system runs smoothly &mdash; if she were to ask for automation, she might appear as if she’s not capable of keeping track of inventory using standard best practices.

Developing an AI inventory management system could streamline this process. By integrating barcode scanning and real-time data syncing, the system could update stock levels and reorder items when they reach a minimum threshold. This would result in fewer stockouts and overstock situations, reducing operational costs and improving sales. Furthermore, Sarah could shift her focus to process optimization and vendor negotiations, areas that could drive higher profitability and help her grow as a leader in the organization.


## The Empathetic AI Leader

For employees like Jada, Emma, Chris, and Sarah, the shame of admitting they need help can make such use cases invisible at first. To establish trust, I resist the urge to dive in immediately to "AI all the things" and instead start by taking some time to learn and understand how the team is currently getting the work done. Once I have an idea for a project, I share it with employees to get their feedback. After some refinement, I present a plan to the leadership team.

The leaders who are most successful with AI understand that being an empathetic ear to the folks in the trenches is the best way. They understand that total automation (i.e. replacing workers with AI) almost never works. They understand that transparency reduces fear and builds confidence. With a culture of trust comes a workplace where employees feel safe enough to identify the tasks ripe for automation. With trust comes a workforce that is motivated to help make better tools and processes. By removing the stigma around automation, we not only improve business outcomes but also empower employees to do the work they were hired to do.

**Here's a tip...** Get the ball rolling! At your next All Hands Meeting, share an example of a repetitive, boring task you have had to do (either recently or in the past) and talk about how it made you feel.
