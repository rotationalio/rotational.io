Each morning, I make the mistake of checking social media before getting out of bed. As I catch up on what’s happening in the world, I often find myself thinking “This too much” all before 8 AM.

Even if you don’t start your mornings making the same bad decision that I do, it’s possible that you have felt overwhelmed. Last year, [262,735 employees in the tech industry were laid off](https://layoffs.fyi/). At the same time, 2023 could be considered generative AI's ["breakout year"](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year). Although keeping up with new products and trends is expected in our industry, trying to keep up with all the rapid changes brought on by AI has been challenging. Add in world news and personal situations and well it's easy to see why so many are running out of energy. Feeling overwhelmed is natural, but what can we do to not let it consume us?

An important place to start is to determine what's causing these emotions.
