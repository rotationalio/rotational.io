There’s a new proclamation almost daily about how AI will make something obsolete. Automation and advances in technology aren’t new. Yet, reading that [38% of companies expect AI to replace workers](https://www.staffingindustry.com/news/global-daily-news/30-of-companies-swapped-workers-for-ai-in-2024-more-to-come) feels myopic.

## Change is inevitable, but let's pump the brakes

On the surface, it appears that this is possible. There are so many things that the current AI tools are able to do effectively such as document summarization, image generation, and translation. On top of that, these tools can perform these tasks in a fraction of the time it would take a human. This is because these systems are good at processing large amounts of data at breakneck speed, and are able to use pattern recognition to mimic the work of humans.

But let’s take a step back and consider prior innovations. Calculators can perform complex math calculations faster than any human being can. So did we stop learning math as a result? Were jobs such as bookkeeping, which largely involve performing mathematical calculations replaced by calculators? The answer is no.

Technological revolutions have led to the invention of products and services we never thought we needed. We would have probably laughed if someone told us 20 years ago that our lives would feel incomplete without our phones. 

If we look back on what all has been created over the last 20 years, not only has the way we interact with the world changed, the types of jobs available to us have as well.

Those who have paused hiring because of the belief that AI can replace the need for workers have the following misguided ideas:
- All of an employee’s tasks can be completely automated away.
- The productivity gains obtained via the adoption of AI tools means that the tasks that can’t be automated away will be spread amongst fewer employees.

Not only could this lead to a steep decline in employee retention, but it could negatively impact a company’s culture as well. 

Who’s going to want to continue to work for a company knowing that the goal is to replace workers instead of helping them? Will there really be less work for those who remain to feel excited about going to work?

## AI can make costly mistakes

In addition, there is an argument to be made as to how effective these solutions are. Even before large language models (LLMs) came onto the scene, there were many machine learning algorithms that were introduced and hyped in a similar fashion to solve problems such as fraud and spam detection. Years later, in spite of the progress made, neither problem is fully solved.

Furthermore, in spite of ChatGPT’s success, there were many problems that companies faced when using the technology to automate functions. Air Canada was [forced to pay](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/air-canada-chatbot-lawsuit) one of its customers after its chatbot mistakenly stated that the customer can apply for bereavement rates and will be refunded retroactively. LLMs also have the tendency to hallucinate and produce incorrect results.

While the technology is improving rapidly and a lot of improvements have been made to resolve these problems, there is an issue with the thinking that human beings will be rendered obsolete due to AI. LLMs do not have the ability to reason. They [mimic the reasoning](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-ai-llm-reasoning-research/?ref=2ndbreakfast.audreywatters.com) observed in the data that they are trained on.

## The complexity of work

There is a fundamental misunderstanding of the work human beings do. Everything we have mentioned so far that AI is capable of doing are discrete tasks with a finite set of inputs and outputs. But the work that human beings do is more than discrete tasks. Human beings perform complex functions, coordinate with a team, and work with stakeholders to deliver a product or service. There is a lot of uncertainty and back and forth and iterative work that is involved. None of this can be easily captured into a training program for an AI tool to mimic.

Let’s take customer service as an example. Chatbots have been touted as the replacement for customer service and yet customer service is only getting worse. This is because many companies have chosen to automate a function that is still largely not automatable. The companies that do provide excellent customer service recognize that there are parts of the job that are discrete tasks where machine learning and software automation can be used to reduce burden on their customer service staff, who not only have to juggle multiple tasks on a given day but also have to serve multiple customers per day. 

Imagine if a retail customer service associate had a dashboard that provides key details about a loyal customer, including summaries of past interactions, and suggested recommendations based on previous purchases. This customer service associate can use that knowledge to provide service that is tailored for that customer. This increases the odds that both the customer service associate and the customer are satisfied, which increases loyalty and engagement, and also results in higher profits for the company. 

There have also been claims that software engineers can be replaced by tools like Github Copilot and Cursor. The assumption made here is that all software engineers do is write code when the reality is that coding is a fraction of what they do. Software engineers perform many more tasks such as working with stakeholders to understand requirements, creating software design documents, evaluating software solutions, presenting demos, etc. 

Rather than a replacement, tools like Github Copilot and Cursor unlock the ability to rapidly experiment and prototype different solutions while getting end user feedback early and often to speed up time to market. This is akin to the movement to using cloud infrastructure where machines could be rented to prototype applications and then making the infrastructure investment instead of investing significant capital up front on machines that may or may not get used for developing applications.

## Reduce monotony, increase innovation

There are many jobs where employees have to perform a lot of repetitive, mundane tasks that can result in burnout. This is especially the case if they are expected to meet unrealistic deadlines on a continual basis due to the pressures of competition. These tasks can be things like having to constantly search for things in the company intranet, reading through multiple documents, producing summaries, recording meeting minutes, etc. These are areas where AI can be used to free up employees’ time to do work that is more meaningful and creative and can also reduce the pressure of deadlines.

Apart from automating tasks, AI helps employees who struggle with communication to better engage with fellow coworkers by crafting more clear emails and messages. A lot of the challenges within organizations are communication challenges.

Companies that make smart investments in AI to overcome these challenges will stand to profit the most.

It’s impossible to predict what will become popular over the next decade, but it’s safe to bet that AI will play a large role in that. What has never changed and won’t is that businesses exist to solve problems.

Instead of moving work around and allowing employees to take their talent elsewhere, companies should use this time to let them explore new possibilities with AI.
