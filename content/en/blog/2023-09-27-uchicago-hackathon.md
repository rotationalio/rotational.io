Rotational Labs is excited to announce our partnership with the [University of Chicago Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/), including co-hosting a hackathon to help students learn to apply real-time data science techniques to real-world problems.

## Think Beyond the Batch

The objective is to challenge students to "think beyond the batch" by tapping into live data feeds (e.g. the [Data Playground](https://rotational.io/data-playground/)) and building a streaming prediction model using publicly available real-time data APIs. Students will pair the open source online machine learning library [River](https://github.com/online-ml/river) with [Ensign](https://rotational.io/ensign/), our data streaming system built for data science teams.

"We're excited to partner with the team at Rotational Labs for our Fall data science hackathon. This event is a great opportunity for our students to learn about and apply the latest real-time data science techniques to real-world problems while working with experts in the field." says Alison Ossyra, Director of External Partnerships and Career Development at Data Science Institute.

The hackathon will take place online from October 10 to October 18. Winners will be announced October 25.
