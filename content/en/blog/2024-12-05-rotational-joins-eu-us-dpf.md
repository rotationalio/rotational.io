### A Privacy-First Approach to Innovation  

At Rotational Labs, data drives our business, and always will. As we develop and support products and services for ourselves and our clients, we prioritize a privacy-first approach. Internally, we have implemented robust measures to safeguard data and protect our systems, including encryption, password protections, multi-factor authentication (MFA), training, and other critical security mechanisms. We have clear policies never to share or sell data for any reason, full stop.  

### A Public Commitment to Responsible Data Stewardship  

While our internal efforts and policies are intentional and effective, we recognize the growing importance of making a public commitment to responsible data stewardship on a global scale.  

To reinforce our committment to privacy, Rotational has joined the **[EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)**, a transcontinental initiative sponsored by the U.S. Department of Commerce and its counterparts in the EU and UK. The DPF establishes rigorous data protection policies, promotes responsible data use, and ensures independent recourse for dispute resolution.  

### Privacy in the Age of Generative AI  

With the rapid rise of generative AI technologies, the importance of privacy has never been greater. Generative AI relies on vast amounts of data, and ensuring that this data is collected, stored, and used responsibly is critical to building trusted systems and protecting businesses, communities, and individuals. By joining the DPF, Rotational affirms its commitment to navigating these advancements ethically and securely.  

### Why This Matters  

We’ve made this commitment for ourselves, for our clients, and because privacy matters. Privacy is not an abstract concept — it has tangible impact on businesses, communities, and individuals. It aligns with [our core values of respect and excellence](https://rotational.io/about/).

This step demonstrates that privacy is not only a priority but also part of our accountability framework.  

### Learn More  

We invite you to learn more about our commitment to privacy. You can look up our DPF listing at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list). 

You can also review our [updated Privacy Policy](https://rotational.io/privacy/).  We hope you find it clear, committed, and conscientious.
