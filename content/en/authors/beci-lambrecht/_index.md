Beci works to support project management tasks at Rotational Labs through organization, workflow analysis, and communication. With over 15 years of sales and management experience in the agriculture industry, she enjoys incorporating her skill set in a new sector with Rotational's growing team. When not at work, she can probably be found on a horse, somewhere on her family's ranch.
