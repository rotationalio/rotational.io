description: Are your human analysts working overtime to process unstructured text?
problem: At Supply Chain Defense (SCD), a division of BlueVoyant, domain experts review the cybersecurity postures of government vendors of software and services. SCD analysts must review huge quantities of documents, assess their sufficiency, and provide constructive criticism to vendors to ensure they are meeting industry best practices.
approach: The Rotational team paired with SCD analysts to compile a dataset, finetune an open source LLM, and train a domain classifier. Domain experts on the client side were able to explore the model's results using a convenient diagnostic UI, and provide feedback to improve the model's accuracy.
result: Rotational implemented a custom semantic search solution to reduce the amount of manual document review by SCD domain experts by one third.
