description: Do you have to move private customer data between data systems? Learn how we implemented a secure peer-to-peer protocol for personally-identifiable and sensitive financial information that fulfills compliance requirements in over 20 jurisdictions worldwide.
problem: TRISA, a global non-profit organization supporting the lawful cross-border exchange of digital assets, published a white paper specifying an open source, privacy-preserving, interoperable, and secure protocol to help financial institutions comply with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule for anti-money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance. TRISA needed a technical partner to transform their idea into a concrete and accessible solution for member institutions.
approach: Rotational worked with the TRISA board and institutional stakeholders to outline an initial product requirements document and scope a roadmap. Rotational then developed the open source repositories, built application programming interfaces (APIs), published documentation in five languages, created a sandbox environment and automated testing tools, and launched TRISAâ€™s Global Directory Service (GDS) portal for compliance. The GDS employs public key infrastructure, is replicated across three continents and is a secure, highly-available system.
result: TRISA is now the default solution for over 100 institutions in over 20 jurisdictions, protecting sensitive PII and financial information. TRISA is also the only compliance protocol interoperable with three industry solutions. Rotational continues to support TRISA as regulations evolve, and more travel rule solutions seek to integrate with TRISA.
