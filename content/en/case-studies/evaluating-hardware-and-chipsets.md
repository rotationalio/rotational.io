  title: Real Results
  description: Our edtech client needed to validate the performance of Neural Processing Units (NPUs) for image and text processing use cases in their domain on MediaTek Genio 700 and 1200 boards to ensure optimal product development.
  approach: We implemented a comprehensive performance testing approach using TensorFlow.js. Our methodology included testing key use cases such as image moderation, classification, and textual AI processing. We designed a custom benchmarking framework to measure inference speed, memory usage, and efficiency across both NPUs.
  result: The testing framework identified potential bottlenecks and optimized NPU performance, improving inference speed by 20% and reducing memory usage by 15%, ensuring the client product delivers reliable and efficient AI capabilities.
