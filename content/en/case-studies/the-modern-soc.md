  title: Real Results
  description: Our cybersecurity client has a Security Operations Center (SOC) that manages 2.3 million endpoints, but struggles to scale efficiently. The SOC needs AI/ML automation to improve efficiency and reduce human intervention.
  approach: We assessed SOC operations and data assets to identify automation opportunities using machine learning and LLMs, and developed a strategic plan aligned with the clientâ€™s business goals. This included a roadmap with prioritized automation projects, estimated costs, and impact metrics.
  result: The engagement delivered a coherent strategy and execution path to confidently invest in custom AI solutions that leverage their domain expertise, enhance scalability, and augment L1 analysts, with potential to improve operational efficiency by more than 40% and lower response times, driving greater customer value.
