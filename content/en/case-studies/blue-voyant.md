problem: Our client was looking for a way to improve the efficiency of their analysts by automating the review of a weekly batch of tens of thousands of news articles. The articles had to be reviewed manually by specialists, who were responsible for scanning through articles to identify threats. Preliminary efforts to train a machine learning classifier produced noisy, confusing predictions.

result: “It’s a slam dunk” says our client, who has since been acquired by BlueVoyant. Now the domain-specific model is part of their customer offering, automatically triaging incoming data on a regular basis and saving 20 hours of analyst time per week.
