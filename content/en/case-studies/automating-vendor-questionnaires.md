  title: Real Results
  description: Our cybersecurity client needed a more efficient way for its analysts to streamline the review of lengthy cybersecurity questionnaires and documents to ensure 3rd party vendors met industry best practices and standards for their customers.
  approach: We developed two custom LLMs, using open source models trained on proprietary data and supplemented with NIST standards. We fine-tuned and trained a domain classifier, providing a diagnostic UI for expert feedback to refine accuracy. We then trained and deployed an LLM to evaluate and flag vendor-submitted responses.  
  result: The custom semantic search and evaluation solution reduced manual document review by 33%, significantly improving analyst efficiency and expediting the review process. It also resulted in a 27% improvement in flagging potential risks.
