  title: Real Results
  description: A state power utility needed a way to monitor the state of the electrical grid in real-time, but the volume of data generated was overwhelming for human analysts, leading to potential delays and missed alerts.
  approach: We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify hundreds of thousands of grid states from 2D images, automatically identifying critical patterns and providing confidence thresholds for alerts.
  result: The solution reduced the number of images requiring human review, improved grid monitoring efficiency, and helped reduce response time to grid anomalies by 25%.
