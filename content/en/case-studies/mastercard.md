problem: CipherTrace, a division of Mastercard, which provides digital asset risk intelligence products to financial institutions and clients, approached Rotational to design, prototype, and develop an anti-money laundering (AML) product. The objective was to launch a revenue-generating product that would empower client institutions to expand globally by integrating blockchain analytics into their compliance workflows.
approach: Rotational worked with the principal product manager to design, scope, and sequence the AML product roadmap. Requirements included a cloud-native solution that was easy to implement, met Financial Action Task Force (FATF) rules, was compatible with international messaging standards, and could support real-time risk scoring.
result: CipherTrace launched the product in 2021 and it became their best-selling solution, helping Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) comply with global “Travel Rule” regulations and manage counterparty risk. Rotational continues to support the client's product roadmap as the regulatory environment evolves.
