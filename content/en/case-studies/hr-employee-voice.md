  title: Real Results
  description: The client’s HR team struggled to process large volumes of employee feedback from satisfaction surveys. Categorizing, summarizing, and identifying key patterns was labor-intensive, often taking so long that insights were outdated and irrelevant by the time they reached leadership.
  approach: Rotational implemented an AI-driven solution using natural language processing (NLP) to categorize employee comments from surveys. The system used sentiment analysis to assess the emotional tone of feedback and applied topic modeling to automatically group comments by themes, identifying key patterns. A priority ranking algorithm was deployed to flag critical issues based on frequency and sentiment, providing actionable insights for HR and leadership. The platform generated real-time dashboards, enabling both HR and executives to view prioritized concerns and track employee sentiment over time, significantly reducing manual analysis efforts.
  result: After using Rotational’s solution, the client cut analysis time by 70%, instantly categorized employee feedback, and prioritized key issues for HR and leadership. This led to more timely decision-making, faster issue resolution, and significantly improved employee satisfaction.
