name: "Mistakes Were Made: Data Science Ten Years In | PyData London 2024"
description: To honor ten years of PyData London, join Dr. Rebecca Bilbro as she takes us back in time to reflect on a little over ten years working as a data scientist. One of the many renegade PhDs who joined the fledgling field of data science of the 2010's, Rebecca will share lessons learned the hard way, often from watching data science projects go sideways and learning to fix broken things. Through the lens of these canon events, she'll identify some of the anti-patterns and red flags she's learned to steer around. She also talks about how her practice of data science has changed over time, and share a handful of fairly generalizable techniques that work for her, her students, and her engineering team at Rotational Labs.
