description: The global gaming market size was valued at USD 249.55 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow from USD 281.77 billion in 2023 to USD 665.77 billion by 2030. Are you curious to dip into the stream of gamer data to get a better sense of what's coming next in the gaming world? The Steam API allows users to fetch statistics for individual games, data about users, or news feeds for game updates. Use Ensign with this data source to generate a time-series dataset that you could add to create powerful analytics on top of video game data and inform machine learning models about game popularity and community.
summary: Connect to game review data and start experimenting with game review models and apps.
