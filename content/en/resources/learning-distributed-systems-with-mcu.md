    Curious about distributed systems and looking for an easy way to get the basics? Not quite sure yet if distributed systems are relevant to what you're working on?

    You're in luck! We have a fun, entertaining, and super hero-filled learning session just for you! :)

    If the Multiverse Saga has taught us anything so far, it's that we're all living in a distributed system -- it's about time for you to learn how the rules work!

    Learn about the following core distributed systems principles through the lens of the MCU:
    - Availability
    - Replication
    - Consistency
    - Fault Tolerance
    - Consensus
    - and more!"
