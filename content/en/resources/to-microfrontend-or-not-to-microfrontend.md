name: "To Micro-Frontend or Not to Micro-Frontend 5 Questions to Ask First at React Miami 2023"
description: "Although some may claim microservices are dead, micro-frontends are gaining steam in the React community and amongst frontend developers as a whole. Having applications devoted to small services or specific parts of a website can make it easier and faster to ship updates. However, before choosing to adopt the micro frontend architecture there are questions teams should consider, like how to handle code and dependency duplication and how to ensure consistency across multiple apps. In this talk, I’ll present 5 questions to ask yourself before working with micro-frontends that will help you decide if it’s the optimal solution for your team."
