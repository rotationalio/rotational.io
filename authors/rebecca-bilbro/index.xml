Chatting with a bot isn&amp;rsquo;t the game changer. Instead, AI represents a new method of interacting with complex computing resources and data &amp;ndash; one that is far more accessible than previous methods.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome to the Age of PostSQL</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/age-of-postsql/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 09:44:57 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/age-of-postsql/</guid><description>&lt;p>Calling all programmers!

From high-visibility &lt;a href="https://layoffs.fyi/">layoff cycles&lt;/a> at FAANGs and crypto companies, to turbulence in our &lt;a href="https://rotational.io/blog/twitter-wont-disappear-overnight/">social media infrastructure&lt;/a>, to pop culture&amp;rsquo;s discovery of deep learning products like AI art and ChatGPT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But many of us in tech are beginning to sense even bigger, deeper rumblings that suggest some fundamental changes afoot for commercial cloud and managed services. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore three: (1) native observability, (2) cost-effective scaling, and (3) self-orchestration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Eventing Platform Landscape</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/eventing-platforms/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 12:28:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/eventing-platforms/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kafka and PubSub and Kinesis, oh my!

We’ve learned a lot along the way, especially about some of the key misconceptions that continue to challenge builders, users, investors, and other crypto stakeholders.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Developers Don't Translate The Docs</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/why-devs-dont-translate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 20:25:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/why-devs-dont-translate/</guid><description>&lt;p>Stars, forks, likes, upvotes, downloads.

And that&amp;rsquo;s hard. For most of the time people have been making things, we&amp;rsquo;ve been mainly concerned with making them user-friendly for just &lt;em>us&lt;/em>. And, even if the last few decades of app development have brought more focus to the importance of empathy (especially if it helps you capture market share), the last few years have forced app developers to acknowledge the continued pervasiveness of white privilege, gender privilege, and class privilege in UI/UX. Unfortunately, as our efforts to become more intentional and empathetic as technologists continue in the coming years, there is another problem we have barely considered that will become a major threat to compassionate, egalitarian, and even subversive app development. Spoiler: it&amp;rsquo;s our cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Google's Secret Manager API with Go</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/secrets-manager-with-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 08:26:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/secrets-manager-with-go/</guid><description>&lt;p>Security is by definition an inconvenience. At the very least, it&amp;rsquo;s about making access to data as challenging as possible for the baddies, conveniently measured in computation time. But good security also requires us good folks to go above and beyond — adopting architectural and engineering practices that involve more forethought, more effort, and more testing than are strictly required to get a basic application running on the web. If you&amp;rsquo;re here already, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to convince you that the effort is well worth it; good security pays for itself in customer trust, not to mention helping to preclude the kinds of breaches that can get careless folks in hot water. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into Google&amp;rsquo;s Secret Manager service, walk through the setup steps, and explore some Go code to interact with the API.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What Are Protocol Buffers?</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/what-are-protocol-buffers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 11:05:32 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/what-are-protocol-buffers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Protocol buffers are a method for serializing data to efficiently send between programs. The structure is reminiscent of XML or JSON, but unlike these more commonly used text-based serialization methods, protocol buffers are designed to produce extremely compact messages using a binary format. The main tradeoff is that protocol buffers aren&amp;rsquo;t human-readable, so when developing APIs, it&amp;rsquo;s always important to consider the use case. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore some of the use cases for protobufs and get to know the syntax.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Can't Read, Won't Buy</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/cant-read-wont-buy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 11:24:40 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/cant-read-wont-buy/</guid><description>&lt;p>To say we are not at our most empowered when trying to communicate in an unfamiliar language is a bit of an understatement. As if the limitations of one&amp;rsquo;s own language weren&amp;rsquo;t bad enough, trying to get along in a different language often makes you feel downright &lt;em>helpless&lt;/em>. Research suggests these feelings also strongly inform consumers&amp;rsquo; buying decisions. What does this mean for companies who want to connect with users in other countries and cultures? In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll explore some of the drawbacks of using English-only as a sales medium, check out some creative solutions, and consider what this all means for global app development.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Parrot Trainer Eats Crow</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/a-parrot-trainer-eats-crow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 08:42:21 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/a-parrot-trainer-eats-crow/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll consider how it is that models trained on massive datasets using millions of parameters can be both &amp;ldquo;low bias&amp;rdquo; and also &lt;em>very biased&lt;/em>, and begin to think through what we in the ML community might be able to do about it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
