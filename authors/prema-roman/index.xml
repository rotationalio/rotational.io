For many years, Pandas has been my go-to. But it can really slow you down when you&amp;rsquo;re working with big or high-dimensional data. Enter Polars!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using River and Vowpal Wabbit to Build Real-Time Machine Learning Models</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/realtime-machine-learning/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 15:19:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/realtime-machine-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p>Real-time ML models continually learn on new data as soon as it arrives, so they&amp;rsquo;re less susceptible to concept drift and data drift. Read on to learn how to use River and Vowpal Wabbit to build real-time models in Python.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Double-Checked Locking</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/double-checked-locking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2023 12:31:07 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/double-checked-locking/</guid><description>&lt;p>Double-checked locking is a common mechanism to avoid race conditions when using read and write locks. Unfortunately, as with nearly all things related to concurrency, it is easy to get wrong or forget.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Prototyping Event-Driven Applications With Watermill</title><link>https://rotational.io/blog/prototyping-eda-with-watermill/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 11:13:46 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://rotational.io/blog/prototyping-eda-with-watermill/</guid><description>&lt;p>Event-driven architectures (EDA) are &lt;a href="https://rotational.io/blog/five-technologies-quietly-transforming-the-web/">enjoying a resurgence in interest&lt;/a> due to many organizations&amp;rsquo; need to accelerate rapid prototyping and get by with smaller, more cross-functional teams. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to get started prototyping EDAs with the open source package Watermill.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
