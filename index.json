Over 20 million people travel to the DC every year, and it has an extensive subway system that locals call \"Metro\". The Metro gets a lot of traffic, including from locals, but also from large numbers of tourists from around the world. Transportation data often displays very interesting temporal patterns that are impossible to capture without a time series dataset. Think that might be useful for something you're researching?
