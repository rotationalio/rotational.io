At the very least, it&amp;rsquo;s about making access to data as challenging as possible for the baddies, conveniently measured in computation time. But good security also requires us good folks to go above and beyond â€” adopting architectural and engineering practices that involve more forethought, more effort, and more testing than are strictly required to get a basic application running on the web. If you&amp;rsquo;re here already, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to convince you that the effort is well worth it; good security pays for itself in customer trust, not to mention helping to preclude the kinds of breaches that can get careless folks in hot water. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into Google&amp;rsquo;s Secret Manager service, walk through the setup steps, and explore some Go code to interact with the API.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
